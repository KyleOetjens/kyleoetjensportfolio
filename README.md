# Kyle Oetjens Portfolio

## Description

Creating a portfolio page to show off my work and progress.  This will be a place for others to come and view all my best/current work.  


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
